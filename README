Software installation - Version 3.0
=================================== 

The software is normally downloaded from the BRCC website:
https://bobrathbone.com/raspberrypi/pi_internet_radio.html
It is the web interface for the radiod package.
See: https://bobrathbone.com/raspberrypi/pi_internet_radio.html

Two packages are availble for the Bookworm OS

radiodweb_3.0_arm64.deb Bookworm 64-Bit OS  PHP 8.2 

Install pre-requisites
----------------------
Run update to refresh package lists.
$ sudo apt update
(The $ sign means the Command Line prompt - Don't copy it, just copy the instruction)

Now upgrade the packages
$ sudo apt upgrade

Re-run the update to refresh package lists.
$ sudo apt update

Now install Apache and the PHP libraries for Apache as user root.
